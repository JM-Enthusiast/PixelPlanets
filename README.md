# PixelPlanets
### Original project by Deep-Fold
I simply added a randomized color functionnality (it's not super great but at least it works).

A collection of Godot shaders to generate pixel planets. Try a web version here: https://deep-fold.itch.io/pixel-planet-generator
The web version only exposes some options, to use all options (noise generation, lighting, colors, etc.) you have to use the actual shaders.

Godot shader code is GLSL. Big thanks to EnthusiastGuy who made a MonoGame HLSL version of the shaders, see here: https://github.com/EnthusiastGuy/MonoGame-Pixel-Planets
